        <div class="mainText">
          <p>The Nerevarine first arrives in Morrowind from the Imperial City for unknown reasons, though likely because the emperor believed they fulfill the prophecy.They are awakened from their slumber by a Dunmer known as Jiub, who states that they have arrived in the province of Morrowind.Soon, a guard escorts the Nerevarine to a Census and Excise office in the town of Seyda Neen on the island of Vvardenfell, where they are given the task to speak with Caius Cosades in Balmora, who makes them a member of the Blades.</p>

          <p>Caius provides the Nerevarine with a few tasks that revolve around seeking information about a few major plot points: the Sixth House, the Nerevarine Cult, and the prophecy. To gather information about the Nerevarine Cult, the Nerevarine seeks out an Ashlander, Hassour. He learns that the Nerevarine Cult is the belief that Indoril Nerevar will be reincarnated and will reinstate the worship of Azura, Boethiah, and Mephala, cast down the Tribunal, and destroy Dagoth Ur.</p>

          <p>Caius later tells the Nerevarine that a House Dagoth base has been discovered near the settlement of Gnaar Mok and that they need to venture into a Sixth House Base, Ilunibi, which Dagoth Gares controls. The Nerevarine then goes to the cavern of Ilunibi, where with his last breath Gares curses the Nerevarine with Corprus. The Nerevarine journeys to Tel Fyr, where the great wizard Divayth Fyr lives, to ask him for a cure. The Nerevarine then returns to Balmora, where Caius Cosades reveals that he is being recalled to Cyrodiil. As a final task, he sends the Nerevarine to Vivec City to find Mehra Milo. There, the Nerevarine finds out that Mehra had gone missing, and eventually succeeded in saving her in Ministry of Truth. After escaping the city, he traveled to Ebonheart, where he found a way to the monastery of Holamayan and gained guidance from Gilvas Barelo. He then returned to Nibani Maesa, who then gave them three tasks; the first one was to head to the Cavern of the Incarnate, where the Moon-and-Star is found. Azura then speaks to them and gives them her blessing, proving that the Hero is truly Nerevar reborn.</p>

          <p>After becoming Nerevarine of the tribes and Hortator of the three Great Houses, he was given a message saying to speak with the Archcanon of the Temple, Tholer Saryoni, who arranged for the Nerevarine to meet with Vivec. During the meeting, Vivec gave the Nerevarine Wraithguard, one of the tools of Kagrenac used to make the Tribunal gods, but also to kill Dagoth Ur by destroying the Heart of Lorkhan, as Dagoth Ur's life is connected to the Heart. The Nerevarine went to Red Mountain, where he found the other tools, Keening and Sunder. He then fought Dagoth Ur in Red Mountain, killing him and severing the Heart from the mortal plane, thus saving all of Morrowind from the Blight.</p>
